# React Developer Tools

[React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) extension allows to inspect React components.

With the extension installed and the React App running, the React DevTools extension icon will change from inactive to active. If the page is using the production build of React, the icon will look according to that.

In Chrome DevTools, we get 2 new tabs: _Components_ and _Profiler_.
