# React Developer Tools

## Install React Developer Tools

Facebook created a Chrome extension to help with debugging React Apps.

[React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) allow to inspect React components, view their properties, interact with them while looking at the application in Google Chrome.

## Inspect React components

With the extension installed and the React App running `npm start`, the React DevTools extension icon will change from inactive to active. If the page is using the production build of React,the icon will look according to that.

To open the React DevTools, open Chrome DevTools -> Two new tabs: _Components_ and _Profiler_.
