# TypeScript and JavaScript

**TypeScript** _is a superset of JavaScript._ This means that JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code, but, TypeScript provides additional features that make it more reliable.

TypeScript code is compiled into JavaScript code,

| Feature | JavaScript        | TypeScript       |
| ------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Typing  | dynamically-typed | statically typed |
| OOP     | Prototype-based   | OOP              |
