## Responsive Images Overview

Responsive images is a concept about providing the right image to the right screen size, resolution, pixel ratio.

Responsive images is also an aspect of web performance (not downloading unnecessary images on smaller screens). For instance, an image of 2mb is ok for a desktop computer, but for a phone we should deliver a compressed version of the image.

**Three use cases for Responsive Images:**

1. **Art Direction:** deliver a different version of the image for a different screen size (design reasons).

2. **Resolution Switching:** for smaller screens, deliver the same image but with a smaller resolution.

3. **Density Switching:** deliver the right image based on the pixel density of the device screen.

## Image Optimizations

Image Optimizations in terms of dimensions and of file size.

**Rule:** The image size should be double of the size that it is displayed on the screen.

High density screens needs 2px of the image to display 1px in the design.

**Step 1:** Start with a big image, and when we finish the design, check the largest width that the image would have on the page. Example: largest 200px, so double to 400px. Now resize the image width to 400px.

**Step 2:** Compress the images

- Compress the images in order to reduce the file size. Tool for compressing images [squoosh](https://squoosh.app/)
- Recommended file format: _WebP_. Better alternative, which increases the quality and reduces image size.
- Because not all browsers support WebP, check for browser support.

**Deliver WebP and PNG based on browser support**

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="./img.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <source srcset="./img.png" type="image/png" />
  <img src="./img.png" class="img" alt="" />
</picture>
```

Inside the `<picture>` element, we define possible alternatives for the `<img>` with the `<source>` element.

In the `type` attribute we define the image format.

The browser will select which of these 2 images can display better based on browsers support.

We still have to include `<img>` tag with its `class` and `alt` attributes, because these are the ones that will be used. The browser will replace the `src` of `<img>` with one of the alternatives from `<source>`.

Also, the `src` from `<img>` will act as a fallback in case the browser doesn't understand the `<source` element.

<br>

## Responsive Images in CSS

In HTML, images are embedded using the `<img>` tag, and then in CSS we use the `background-image` property.

Responsive images in CSS refers to the practice of writing media queries to load different images for different situations.

Another type of media query: **device resolution**.

_Reference_: **192 dpi** (dots per inch) is the resolution that apple retina screens use high resolution screens

```CSS
.header {
    background-image: url(./img-small.jpg);

    @media (min-resolution: 192dpi) and (min-width: 37.5em),
           (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (min-width: 37.5em),
           (min-width: 125em) {
                background-image: url(./img.jpg);
            }
}
```

The code above translates to:

- Normally (for small resolution screens), load a small image.
- Whenever the resolution is higher than 192 dots per inch, and the screen width is higher than 600px, then load a high resolution image.
- As second condition, for cases when the screen is huge (starting at 2000px) and have 1x resolution, then also load the high quality image.

In addition to 192 dpi, we also include a min-width of 600px too, because there might be phones with high resolution but with small screens, so there is no need to load a big image for them.

Safari doesn't support (min-resolution: 192dpi). For safari we use device-pixel-ratio property and then equal to 2, which means 2x (same as having 192dpi).

<br>

## Art Direction

Art Direction is like using media queries but in HTML. We make images depend on the screen width, so that different images will be used on different screen widths in the same place.

```HTML
<picture>
    <source srcset="logo-x1.png 1x, logo-2x.png 2x" media="(max-width: 37.5em)" />
    <source srcset="logo-big-x1.png 1x, logo-big-2x.png 2x" media="(max-width: 50em)" />
    <img srcset="logo-onex.png 1x, logo-twox 2x" src="logo-twox.png" />
</picture>
```

Inside the `media` attribute we specify the breakpoint.

We can have multiple `<source>` elements for different breakpoints.

`<img>` will act like a fallback in case the browser doesn't support the feature.

_Note:_ you have to include the `<img>` element with its `src` attribute in order for `<source>` tags to work properly.

<br>

## Density Switching

Serve a larger version of the same image for high resolution screens, and serve a smaller version of the same image for a low density screen.

In the `srcset` attribute we specify 2 images and the **density descriptor** `1x 2x` for each.

```HTML
<img  srcset="logo-1x.png 1x, logo-2x.png 2x" />
```

The browser will choose the best option according to the screen that is displaying the webpage. For low density screens, it will use the 1x image. And then for high resolution screens the 2x image will be used.

_Explanation:_ Pixel density is the amount of pixels found in an inch.

There are low resolution screens and high resolution screens. If we want our images to look sharp on high-resolution screens, we need to provide a proper image.

- _Low resolution screens_ (**1x**) are typical PC screens which uses 1px to display 1px of the design. If we say an image should be 100px, then these screens would use 100 physical pixels in the screen to display these 100px.
- _High resolution screens_ (**2x**) uses 2 physical pixels to display one pixel of our design. If we say an image should be 100px high, it will use 200px in a physical screen.

## Density and Resolution Switching

Let the browser choose the best image for the current viewport and for the pixel density:

```html
<img
  srcset="nat-1.jpg 300w, nat-1-large.jpg 1000w"
  sizes="(max-width: 900px) 20vw, (max-width: 600px) 30vw, 300px"
  src="nat-1-large.jpg"
/>
```

`srcset` - 2 images, 300px and 1000px width. Instead of density descriptors, we specify the **width descriptors**. We inform the browser of the width for each image, without the browser having to download them to get access to that information. Knowing the image width is not enough for the browser to choose the right image, we still need the sizes attribute.

`sizes` - inform the browser about the approximate width of the image at different viewport width. As values - breakpoints approximately that the width of the image will be.

- _900px_ - then the image width 20vw (20% of the screen width viewport).
- _600px_ - here the image width is 30% of the screen width, 30vw.
- At the end, specify the default size, approximately 300px, if none of the before conditions apply.
- Don’t forget about the alt attribute.

With both srcset and sizes - the browser can figure out which is the perfect image to use for the current viewport width and the current display resolution.

`src` - we should include this too, in case the user is using an older browser which doesn’t support srcset or sizes. If the browser cant understand any of those, he can still use the src attribute.

This example will take care for both, resolution and density switching. We gave the browser enough information to figure out exactly what to do depending on both the viewport and the pixel density (screen resolution).
