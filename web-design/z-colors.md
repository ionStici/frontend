## Color Wheel

The Color Wheel is comprised of three color groups: primary, secondary, tertiary.

Primary colors: red, blue, yellow. Equidistant to each other, forming a triangle. They are the basis for all other colors.

Secondary colors are created by mixing two primary colors, forming: green, orange, purple.

Tertiary colors are formed when mixing a secondary and primary and resuling in a two-word name: Red-orange (Vermillion), Yellow-orange (Amber), Yellow-green (Chartreuse), Blue-green (Teal), Blue-purple (Violet), Red-purple (Magenta).

### HSLA

HSLA is the preferred syntax for setting colors. HSLA is the most semantic system of setting colors with CSS. Its's the most intuitively adjusted.

Using values that have semantic meaning gives the designer more direct control over the color scheme, and more direct ability to manage contrast and create related color schemes.

- The “pure” color is set with the Hue. This is expressed as the angle in degrees around the color wheel.
- Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of that hue. Colors with full saturation (100%) are the color itself, colors with no saturation (0%) are completely grayscale.
- Lightness refers to the lightness of the color. 0% is black, 100% is white.
- A, or alpha, refers to the opacity. 0% is fully transparent, 100% is fully opaque.

Warm Colors range between red and yellow (Feeling of aggression, blod).

On the other side of the color wheel in contrast to warm colors, there are: Cool Colors range between blue, purple and green (calming, soothing nature).

## Tints and Shades

You can also increase and decrease the lightness of a color, resulting in tints and shades of a hue, respectively.

Tints occur when white is applied to a color, adding or increasing the lightness of a hue.

Shades are created when black is added to a color, which decreases the lightness of a hue.

In HSLA, tints and shades are determined by the third number, which is L for lightness. This starts at 0% (black) and ranges to 100% (white).

Understanding how to use tints and shades of a color can help in creating a wider range of colors you could apply to your websites.

## Color Contrast

Colors opposite of each other on the color wheel tend to have a higher contrast. Colors that fall next to each other have a lower contrast to one another.

When applying color to your designs, it’s vital to ensure contrast levels provide clarity to the users for the elements on your page. For instance, you wouldn’t want to use a light color on a white background or a detailed background. It’s essential to try and increase the contrast of your designs in order to promote ease of use and legibility.

This is also the reason why you often see dark gray or black text on a white background. The high contrast between the two colors provides the best ability for users to read the information without any difficulty.

## Color Schemes

Color schemes (or color palettes) are the result of pairing two or more colors together. The colors you select can make or break your design, however, knowing your options will put you in a better place to determine what is best for moving forward.

When deciding which colors to use in your design, there are four different color schemes to consider:

- Monochromatic
- Complementary
- Analogous
- Triadic

## Monochromatic Designs

Monochromatic scheme utilizes a single color with varying shades and tints to create a monochromatic palette.

Each color in the scheme is derived from the base color. While all elements within the design may feel similar, you can help eliminate the monotonous feeling with high contrast. This means when you are selecting a monochromatic color scheme, it’s important to select a much lighter and much darker shade of the main color.

These monochromatic color schemes are beneficial in that they provide an organized impression when applied to your designs. The use of a single color can provide an immediate sense of harmony.

Monochromatic schemes can also consist of black and white, with varying shades of gray, as you see in our current site.

## Complementary Designs

A complementary color scheme utilizes colors opposite from each other on the color wheel.

For instance, if you were to select blue as your main color, it would create maximum contrast and intensity with orange.

Complementary color schemes are popular on the web as they have high contrast in the color pairing.

They can seem clashing if complementary colors are used for large areas that are directly next to each other. However, when used strategically, they can draw attention to certain elements on the page that you want users to focus on.

## Analogous Color Schemes

Analogous color schemes apply three or more colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel. Typically, there is one dominant color (or hue), combined with a second to support, and a third to accent the color palette.

Analogous color schemes create a visually pleasing and calming display. For instance, the color blue can pair nicely with both teal and green. However, analogous color schemes provide a low-contrast experience, since all colors fall in line with one another.

They shouldn’t be used for content that needs the user’s direct attention, but they can be used to create backgrounds that do not compete with the main content of the site.

## Triadic Color Schemes

These consist of three colors that are equidistant from each other on the color wheel. forming a triangle

For instance, if we stick with blue being our main color, we would then select red-orange and yellow-green as the pairing combinations. This creates a triangle of colors within the color wheel and gives us a wider palette to choose from.

Triadic color schemes are useful in that they create a sense of equality, vibrancy, and security in your designs.

## Color Psychology

Every color has a different context and meaning, and color psychology can impact how people perceive a design and relate to the colors used. Choosing the right colors can help nonverbally communicate the context and emotion of a product or service.

Each color has a specific meaning (both positive and negative), which can evoke emotions from a user. For instance, here’s a list of words often associated with colors:

- Red: Passionate, energetic, angry
- Orange: Optimistic, playful, fun
- Yellow: Welcoming, intellectual, impatient
- Green: Prosperous, balanced, growing
- Blue: Peaceful, loyal, cold
- Purple: Imaginative, royal, spiritual
- Gray: Unemotional, compromising
- White: Innocent, pure
- Black: Luxurious, powerful

It’s also important to note that color associations may vary from other parts of the world as well. However, when selecting colors, be sure to choose ones that help reinforce the overall message and tone of the website!

## Best Practices

Now that we’ve talked through how to choose the proper colors for your designs, there are some best practices to consider as well.

**Use neon colors sparingly.** While the use of neon colors can feel hip, they are often hard on a user’s eyes.

**Avoid vibrating colors.** Vibrating colors result from pairing two colors with high saturation together that may be complementary to one another. It creates a glowing or moving effect, which also can be hard on one’s eyes.

For example, the red and green pairing that is common with Christmas cards is very glaring when presented on a screen. See the example to the right to notice how intense and distracting this pairing feels.

**Use backdrops to separate vibrating colors.** In the example, the white backdrop behind the green card reduces the space where the contrasting colors (red and green) are directly next to each other, but the overall effect is still too intense for most websites.

**Avoid color combinations with insufficient contrast**, including:

- Bright colors on top of bright colors
- Light colors on top of light colors
- Dark colors on top of dark colors

Even if there’s enough contrast in these pairings for the different colors to be legible, they likely won’t create enough contrast to attract the user’s attention.

Remember that most users skim websites! They are not reading every word and checking every menu—you need to guide the user to the most important content with good color choices.
