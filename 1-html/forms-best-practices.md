# Forms best practices

- Intuitive UI

- Every form control must have an associated `<label>` element describing the purpose of the form control.

- **Short labels** are easier to scan, reduce visual clutter, and help users to understand what data is needed faster.

- Don’t Use The Placeholder Attribute, use lavels instead.

- Position the label above the form control.

- Use the appropriate form controls. E.g. by using `type="tel"`, users on touch devices get a keypad optimized for entering numbers.

- Best: Single column forms, only one direction to follow.

- Ensure that forms are accessible for people who use only the keyboard to navigate websites.

- Make your buttons big enough, at least 48px in height.

- Make it clear to users what data to enter and which fields are required.

- Include explicit error messages next to the form control when it is not filled out correctly.

- Use `aria-live="assertive"` for error messages.

- In addition to color, use an icon, or prefix your error messages with the error type.

- Use `:focus` CSS pseudo-class to differentiate the currently focused form control

- Don't forget about `<html lang="en-us">`

- Use the `dir` attribute to define the current writing systems

- To make it quick and easy to enter names, use a single form field for names wherever possible.
