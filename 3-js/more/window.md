history api of the browsers. pushState method allows us to change the url without reloading the page. pushState takes 3 arguments, first one is called state which doesnâ€™t really matter, second called title which is also not relevant. And the third one important is the actual url.
window.history.pushState(null, '', `#${model.state.recipe.id}`);
We can do all kinds of other stuff with history api, for example going back and forth as if we were clicking the forward and back buttons in the browser.
