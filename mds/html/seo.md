# SEO

**SEO** (Search Engine Optimization) is the means by which websites appear in search engines.

More than 90% of web traffic comes through search engines. If you want your website to be seen, you want to be appearing in relevant search results, based on relevance and quality.

**Criteria to consider:**

- Quality Content
- Accessibility
- Performance & JavaScript
- Structured Data
- Mobile-First

Implementing best practice can produce immediate results, but long-term performance requires long-term maintenance.
