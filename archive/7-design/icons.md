# Icon Rules

- **01.** Use a good icon pack, there are tons of free and paid icon packs
- **02.** Use only one icon pack. Don't mix icons from different packs
- **03.** Use SVG icons or icon fonts. Don't use bitmap image format (jpg and png)
- **04.**

<div></div>

- **05.** Use icons to provide visual assistance to text
- **06.** Use icons for product feature blocks
- **07.** Use icons associated with actions, and label them (unless no space or icon is 100% clear)
- **08.** Use icons as bullet points

<div></div>

- **09.** To keep icons neutral, use same color as text. To draw more attention, use different color
- **10.** Don't confuse your users: icons need to make sense and fit the text or action
- **11.** Don't make icons larger than what they were designed for. If needed, enclose them in a shape
