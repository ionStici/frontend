# User Experience (UX) Rules

_UX Rules for Usability_

- **01.** Don't design complicated layouts. Don't reinvent the wheel. Use familiar patterns that users know
- **02.** Make your call-to-action the most prominent element, and make the text descriptive
- **03.** Use blue text and underlined text only for link
- **04.** Animations should have a purpose and be fast: between 200 and 500 milliseconds
- **05.** In forms, align labels and fields in a single vertical line, to make the form easier to scan
- **06.** Offer users a good feedback for all actions: form errors, form success, etc.
- **07.** Place action buttons where they will create an effect (law of locality)

_UX Rules for Website Content_

- **08.** Use a descriptive, keyword-focused headline on your main page. Don't be vague or fancy.
- **09.** Only include relevant information, efficiently. Cut out fluff and make the content 100% clear
- **10.** Use simple words. Avoid technical jargon and "smart-sounding" words
- **11.** Break up long text with sub-headings, images, block quotes, bullet points, etc.

## What is User Experience

**User Interface (UI)** is the visual presentation of a product. It's how the graphical interface looks and feels like. Layout, typography, colors, icons, the overall personality.

**User Experience (UX)** is the overall experience the user has while interacting with the product. "Does the app feel logical and well thought out?", "Does the navigation work intuitively?", "Are users reaching their goals?".

- **UI Design** is graphical interface, is what makes an interface beautiful.
- **UX Design** is exprience with interface, is what makes an interface useful and functional.

UI design is part of UX design.

_UX Design Guiding principle:_ A website exists for a reason: a user has a goal for visiting it, and a business has a goal for creating it.
