<br>

**Step 1 - Define the Project**

- Define: WHO the website is for? Including the target audience. WHAT the website is for? Business and User Goals. To provide information? To sell some product? To entertain the user?

<br>

**Step 2 - Plan the Project**

- **Gather content**: text, images, videos, etc.
- **Plan the sitemap**: what pages the site needs and how they are related to one another (content hierarchy).
- Based on the content you have: plan what sections each page needs in order to convey the content's message, and in which order. The content should guide the project and the design of the website.
- Based on everything you already know about the project: **define the website personality**.

<br>

**Step 3 - Sketch the Layout**

- Think about what **components** you need, and how you can use them in **layout patterns**.
- **Sketch** / experiment with different components and layouts (with pen and paper)
- **Wireframing / Prototyping**

<br>

**Step 4 - Design**

- Design the Application in a design tool
- Consider: Website personality / design guidelines / inspiration / project's branding

<br>

**Step 5 - Build**

- Develop the Application

<br>

**Step 6 - Test and Optimize**

_...before lunching the project to the web_

- Test the app in all major browsers, and on different devices.
- Optimize all images, test app's accessibility, run lighthouse, improve SEO.

<br>

**Step 7 - Launch the Project**

- Deploy the Application on the internet.
- Buy a domain name (representative, memorable, easy to write).

<br>

**Step 8 - Maintain and Keep Updating the Application**

- Install analytic software (Google Analytics or Fathom) to get statistics about website users. This may inform future changes to adapt the site structure and content.
