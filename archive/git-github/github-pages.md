# GitHub Pages

[**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/) - free hosting service.

After you set up hosting using GitHub Pages, future changes you push will be automatically deployed.

## Setup

To deploy a project, got to repo settings, click "Pages", at the "Branch" section switch from "None" to "main", and click "Save".

- **User Site** - You get one user site per GitHub account. This is where you could host a portfolio site or some form of personal website. The default url is based on your GitHub username, following this patterns: `username.github.io` though you can change this.

- **Project Sites** - You get unlimited project sites. Each GitHub repo can have a corresponding hosted website. It's as simple as telling GitHub which specific branch contains the web content. The default urls follow this pattern: `username.github.io/repo-name`
