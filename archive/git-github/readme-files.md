# Readme Files

A README file is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting a GitHub repository. It should include clarification information about the project.

## Conventions of a Good README file

- **Project title** - the name of the project
- **Description** - describe the main purpose of your project. Answer questions like "why did you build this project?" and "what problem(s) does it solve?"
- **Features** - list the project's features.
- **How to use** - write step-by-step instructions on how to install and use the project. Any software or package requirements should also be listed here.
- **Technologies** - list all the technologies and/or frameworks you used and what purpose they serve in this particular project.
- **Collaborators** - write your team members' or collaboratios' names here along with a link to their GitHub profile. You should give credit for their work.
- **License** - list a license on your README so other developers can understand what they can and cannot do with your project.

Keep README files brief but detailed. README should always be up-to-date and self-explanatory.

Tip: Write engaging READMEâ€™s. Make sure they include easy-to-follow details for your project. This improves your documentation skills and makes you a better developer and communicator of code.
