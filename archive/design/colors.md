_Colors and Typography_

- **09.** On dark colored backgrounds, try to use a tint of the backround ("lighter version") for text
- **10.** Text should usually not be completely black. Lighten it up if looks heavy and uninviting
- **11.** Don't make text too light. Use a tool to check the contrast between text and background colors
