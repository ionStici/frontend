# Visual Hierarchy Rules

- **01.** Position important elements closer to the top of the page, where they get more attention
- **02.** Use images mindfully, as they draw a lot of attention (larger images get more attention)
- **03.** Whitespace creates separation, so use whitespace strategically to emphasize elements
- **04.** For text elements, use font size, font weight, color, and whitespace to convey importance
- **05.** What text elements to emphasize? Titles, sub-titles, links, buttons, data points, icons
- **06.** Emphasize an important component using background color, shadow, or border (or multiple)
- **07.** Try emphasizing some component A over component B by de-emphasizing component B
- **08.** What components to emphasize? Testimonials, call-to-action sections, highlight sections, preview cards, forms, pricing tables, important rows/columns in tables, etc.

## What is Visual Hierarchy?

- Visual hierarchy is about establishing which elements of a design are the most important ones

- Visual hierarchy is about drawing attention to these most important elements

- Visual hierarchy is about defining a "path" for users, to guide them through the page

- We use a combination of position, size, colors, spacing, borders, and shadows to establish a meaningul visual hierarchy between elements / components
