# Website Personalities

**Design Rules:** Typography -> Colors -> Images / Illustrations -> Icons -> Shadows -> Border-radius -> Whitespace -> Visual hierarchy -> User Experience -> Components / Layout.

Design decisions for each rule must be applied in different ways based on the **website personality**.

Different personalities have different traits, therefore choices for design ingredients need to be made accordingly.

It looks a lot better if we stay consistent throughout the design based on the design rules.
