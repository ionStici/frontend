_Headline text on images:_

- **07.** Method #1: Darker or brighten image (completely or partially, using a gradient)
- **08.** Method #2: Position text into neutral image area
- **09.** Method #3: Put text in a box

_Some technical details:_

- **10.** To account for high-res screens, make image dimensions 2x as big as their displyed size
- **11.** Compress image for lower file size and better performance
- **12.** When using multiple images side-by-side, make sure they have the exact same dimensions
