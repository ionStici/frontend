# Pull Request

[**Pull Requests Documentation**](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests)

**A Pull Request** is a GitHub feature to review code before merging it.

- Team members can review and discuss a feature branch before merging into main.
- Pull Requests provide a mechanism to approve or reject the work on a given branch.
- They also help facilitate discussion and feedback on the specified commits.

_Pull Request Workflow:_

1. Do some work locally on a feature branch
2. Push up the feature branch to GitHub
3. Open a pull request using the feature branch just pushed up to GitHub
4. Wait for the PR to be approved and merged.

## In Detail

Pull requests allow a streamlined way for project team members to review the code of new features and bug fixes before it is merged to the main branch.

After pushing to GitHub a new feature branch, we open a **Pull Request** to this branch for others to review and approve.

In the Pull Request description field, we must describe the code changes and what feature(s) this merge will add to the main branch.

Our pull request can be accepted or rejected by our teammates. Each pull request has its own discussion forum, creating a place for collaborators to leave feedback. They will review our code, suggest what should be removed or changed, how it can be simplified or improved.

Any further commits we make to the source branch will automatically be reflected in the pull request. Once the changes are accepted by the project's collaborators, the branch can be merged into the repo's main branch.

GitHub will keep this pull request in history as a record of the code change, the contribution, and the discussion that took place.

## Pull Request Structure

- Concisely explain the purpose of the pull request in the title. "Add this feature", "Fix this bug"

- The description: the thought process behind the code changes and the options you have considered.

- Use only relevant information. You can embed screenshots, GIFs, videos of your application.

- Make commit messages clear. Use comments in your code for explanatory purposes.

- Keep pull requests small and fast. Reduce the size of pull requests and respond to reviews quickly.

- Split big features into smaller parts, this will speed up review time.
