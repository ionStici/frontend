# Sketching

**Sketching** - the first step of the design process.

Brainstorming

## Tips and Tricks

- Use Pen and Paper for sketching.
- Draw everything in one continuous stroke

keep it quick and keep it dirty.

Work through all the possible options and find the most effective, user-friendly way to express your interface idea.

Sketching leads to a more effective wireframe stage.

The main purpose of sketches is to visualize quickly the core idea

## Process

1. Focus on ideas
2. Iterate through as many ideas as you can.

- Compare different options
- Take notes, why you choose one over the other
- Resketch winner idea in more detail

Focus on the idea visualization â€“ this is the main goal of the sketch.

Text and Annotations

- Use all capital letters
- Only write annotations horizontally
- Increase weight or size to highlight text, or use color if you have it
- Use the real text inside UI when you need to draw attention to it.

One color pen for drawing attention to specific parts (CTA button, interactions, etc)

0.1-0.25 pen for finer details

0.5 pen for regular purposes

Marker for thicker lines

Shading pen for highlighting as well as showing depth (buttons, modals, popovers, etc)

**Your sketches must illustrate the user flow**

## Sketching

_Sketching is a Two-Step Process:_

1. Generating Ideas: generate as many ideas as possible and choose the most promising ones.
2. Adding Detail and Refinement: filter your sketches / draw important details

- Keep the project objective and target audience in mind when sketching.
- Allocate a time block of 30 minutes (no less) for sketching.

## Getting Started

Start with the frames -> Add the biggest elements -> Add relevant but simple details -> Use notes -> Sketch alternatives -> Pick the best solutions -> Add shadows and bevel -> Take a photo, include it the project repo -> After a break, review the sketches and add more notes.

## Clarifying Sketches with Additional Elements

Find or draw a proper sketch, then add the following details:

1. **Title / Description / Date** (at the top of the sketch)

2. **Annotations:** notes placed close to an element to explain its content or other attributes.

3. **Numbers:** ordered by interaction flow.

4. **Arrows:** for screen transitions, connect different parts of sketches, to indicate a sequence of actions. Above the arrow, add a description of what the arrow is meant to signify.

5. **Notes:** placed at the top of bottom of the page, they describe elements that are not included in the design, questions you may have, general explanations, unsketched ideas, etc.

6. **Gestures:** for touch device designs.

7. **Feedback** from you or others.

Try to use different colors (but be consistent). Black for drawings, blue for links, dark green for notes, red for titles and feedback.

## Tips and Tricks

- Don't worry about the quality.

- **Practice!** Open a web or mobile app and try sketch the screen. Practice drawing basic building blocks of your designs.

- Buy a folder. Keep your skecthes safe.

- Bring tools with you wherever you go (pen and notepad). Capture ideas on paper any time.

- Share with others. Get feedback.

- Experiment and customize, try new things, try new templates.

- Use templates.

## Wireflow

- **High-level flow** - draw the general journey of your product usage.

- **Screen flow** - this focuses on a specific functional flow through the system.

- **Navigation** - information that shows the options a user can choose, the directions user have, and various app parts.

- **Screen states** - draw the states for different elements.

- Save. Make a digital copy of the sketch.

- Share. Share the sketch. Include them it in the project repo.
