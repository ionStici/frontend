# Sketching

The Overall Design Process: **(1) Sketching** -> (2) Wireframing -> (3) Prototyping -> (4) Coding

Pen and Paper

draw everything in one continuous stroke

Brainstorming

keep it quick and keep it dirty.

Work through all the possible options and find the most effective, user-friendly way to express your interface idea.

Sketching leads to a more effective wireframe stage.

The main purpose of sketches is to visualize quickly the core idea

## Process

1. Focus on ideas
2. Iterate through as many ideas as you can.

- Compare different options
- Take notes, why you choose one over the other
- Resketch winner idea in more detail

Focus on the idea visualization â€“ this is the main goal of the sketch.

Text and Annotations

- Use all capital letters
- Only write annotations horizontally
- Increase weight or size to highlight text, or use color if you have it
- Use the real text inside UI when you need to draw attention to it.

One color pen for drawing attention to specific parts (CTA button, interactions, etc)

0.1-0.25 pen for finer details

0.5 pen for regular purposes

Marker for thicker lines

Shading pen for highlighting as well as showing depth (buttons, modals, popovers, etc)

**Your sketches must illustrate the user flow**

## Sketching

_Sketching is a Two-Step Process:_

1. Generating Ideas: generate as many ideas as possible and choose the most promising ones.
2. Adding Detail and Refinement: filter your sketches / draw important details

- Keep the project objective and target audience in mind when sketching.
- Allocate a time block of 30 minutes (no less) for sketching.

## Getting Started

Start with the frames -> Add the biggest elements -> Add relevant but simple details -> Use notes -> Sketch alternatives -> Pick the best solutions -> Add shadows and bevel -> Take a photo, include it the project repo -> After a break, review the sketches and add more notes.

## Clarifying Sketches

Find or draw a proper sketch, then add the following details:

- At the top of the sketch add: title, description, date.
- Annotations: names placed close to an element to explain its content or other attributes.
- Number the elements of your sketch, of the sketches themselves.
- Arrows: for screen transitions, connect different parts of sketches, etc. Add a description of what the arrow is meant to signify.
