# Shadow Rules

- Shadows play an important role in helping users figure out the relantionship between parts of the design.
- The more serious the website personality - the less or no shadow - and the opposite.

- **01.** You don't have to use shadows. Only use them if it makes sense for the website personality
- **02.** Use shadows in small doses, don't add shadows to every element
- **03.** Go light on shadows, don't make them to dark

<div></div>

- **04.** Use small shadows for smaller elements that should stand out (to draw attention)
- **05.** Use medium-sized shadows for larger areas that should stand out a bit more
- **06.** Use large shadows for elements that should really float above the interface

<div></div>

- **07.** Experiment with changing shadows on mouse interaction (click or hover)
- **08.** Bonus: Experiment with glows (colored shadows)

## Shadow Concepts

The more shadow we add to a certain element, the further away from the user interface that element will seem.

Shadows are created in the real world by some light shining at an object, therefore creating a shadow behind it. So in user interface, shadows also simulate the existence of some imaginary light sources.

If the element is only two pixels away from the screen, it makes sense that it cannot cast a large shadow on the rest of the interface - subtle, intuitive - this is what we experience in real world.

On the other hand, if the element is far away from the interface, like 24px, then the element will be able to cast a huge shadow on the interface. Kind of 3 dimensional space.
