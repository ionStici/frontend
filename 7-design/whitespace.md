# Whitespace Design Rules

Whitespace communicates how the different pieces of information in our layout are related to one another. Whitespace creates invisible relationships between the elements of the layout, which makes it easy for the user to navigate the layout completely intuitively.

_Where to use whitespace_

- **01.** Use tons of whitespace between sections
- **02.** Use a lot of whitespace between groups of elements
- **03.** Use whitespace between elements
- **04.** Inside groups of elements, try to use whitespace instead of lines

_How much whitespace_

- **05.** The more some elements (or groups of elements) belong together, the close they should be
- **06.** Start with a lot of whitespace, maybe even too much. Then remove whitespace from there
- **07.** Match other design choises. If you have a big text or big icon set, you need more whitespace
- **08.** Try a hard rule, such as using multiples of 16px for all spacing
