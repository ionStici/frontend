# Elements and Components

- **01.** Use common elements and components to convey your website's information
- **02.** Combine components into layouts using common layout patterns
- **03.** Assemble different layout areas into a complete, final page

## From Elements to Webpage

Basically, we build websites always in the same way

1. **Elements** - we start with some common, small elements, like paragraphs, images, buttons, which will contain our actual content.

2. **Components** - we then assemble these simple elements into common components: feature cards, pricing tables, tab components, etc.

3. **Layouts** - then we take all the components that we designed and use them to build a layout using common layout patterns.

4. **Webpage** - we take all the smaller layouts and assemble a final page from them.

This is how we come up with a final design. These is a system behind all this. A webpage is not just a bunch of random elements tying together. Instead, elements are organized into components, which are then organized into one ormore layouts, which in the end make-up a final webpage.
