# Border Radius Rules

The amount of border-radius that we give to our elements has a big effect on the seriousness of playfulness of our design.

- **01.** Use border-radius to increase the playfulness and fun of the design, to make it less serious
- **02.** Typefaces have a certain roundness, make sure that border-radius matches that roundness
- **03.** Use border-radius on buttons, images, around icons, standour sections and other elements
