## Typography Rules

_Typeface Rules_

- **01.** Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe
- **02.** Use only one typeface per page. Limit your options to two.
- **03.** Choose the right typeface according to your website personality
- **04.** Limit font-size choices. Use a "type scale" tool

_Font Size Rules_

- **05.** Use a font-size between 16px and 32px for "normal" text
- **06.** For long text (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger (easy to read)
- **07.** For headlines, you can go really big (50px+) and blod (600+), depending on personality
- **08.** For any text, dont' use a font weight under 400 regular (hard to read)

_Good Reading Experience Rules_

- **09.** Use less than 75 characters per line (easy to read)
- **10.** For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go below 1.5
- **11.** Decrease letter spacing in headlines (if it looks unnatural)
- **12.** Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and increase letter-spacing
- **13.** Never justify text
- **14.** Dont' center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine

## Serif and Sans-Serif Typefaces

- **Serif Typeface** - typefaces with small details (serifs) at the end of the lines.
- **Sans-Serif Typeface** - typefaces with no decorative lines (clean and simple).
