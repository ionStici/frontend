# Plan the Project: User Stories

Start with a planning phase before building any project.

_(1) User Stories -> (2) Features -> (3) Flowchart -> (4) Architecture_

_Planning phase overview:_ **User Stories (1)** are a high level overview of the whole application, which allows us developers to determine the exact **features (2)** that we need to implement. Then, to visualise the different actions that the user can take, and how the program reacts to these actions, we put all these features into a nice **flowchart (3)**. Once we know exactly what we're gonna build, it's time to think about how we're gonna build it by creating the **project's architecture (4)**. Then we can proceed to the **Development Step** (implementation of our plan using code).

## 1. User Stories

Description of the app's functionality for the **user's perspective**. All user stories put together, provide a clear picture of the app's whole functionality.

We use user stories to describe exactly what the application will do. In real world, you would build the application from scratch on your own. Therefore, you will have to think as if you were the user, and put yourself in the user’s feet so that you can come up with these user stories, and then build your features from there.

_User Story Common Format:_

- As a [type of user], i want [an action] so that [a benefit]. Who + what + why.
- As a certain user, i want to perform a certain action, so that i can get a certain benefit.

Then, analyse the sentence examples, which tells us who wants to perform which action and why. Then, based on this, we will be able to plan the application’s features in the next step, so that the user story can be satisfied.

## 2. Features

According to the user stories we gathered, we identify the **features** our app will have.

## 3. Flowchart

The **flowchart** should contain: the features (what we will build), how the different parts of the application interact with each other, which events make sense to implement, how data flows across the application.

## 4. Architecture

**Architecture** (how to build it) - how we will organize our code, what JavaScript feature we will use. This gives a structure in which we can then develop the application’s functionality.

We don’t always need to have the perfect architecture figured out before implementation. We can do some experiments, and only then think about the architecture for the final project.

Think about how to implement all the functionality and features, before we actually do it. If you don’t think about the architecture before writing the main part of our application, then we will end up with a mess of unmanageable spaghetti code. We can implement any project in 1000 different ways, the possibilities are endless.

Once we thought about the project’s architecture, we are finally done with the planning step, and are then ready to finally move to the development step, where we’re gonna implement the plan that we created, using code.
