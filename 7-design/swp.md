# Sketching, Wireframing, Prototyping

**Sketching** is the most informal stage of the design process, often done with pencil and paper.

- **Purpose:** To quickly jot down ideas and explore various design concepts.
- **Fidelity:** Low-fidelity, meaning it's rough and lacks detail.
- **Interactivity:** None. Sketches are static images.
- **When to Use:** Early in the design process when ideas are still being generated.

**Wireframing** is a visual guide that represents the framework of a website, often created using digital tools.

- **Purpose:** To outline the layout, including the placement of elements, navigation, and basic functionalities, without focusing on colors, fonts, or other visual design details.
- **Fidelity:** Can be low to mid-fidelity, depending on how much detail is included.
- **Interactivity:** None or very minimal. Wireframes are mostly static but may contain basic links to demonstrate navigation.
- **When to Use:** After the sketching phase, when the basic structure of the web pages is being refined.

**Prototyping** is the creation of an interactive model that simulates the final product, often made using specialized software.

- **Purpose:** To test the functionality, interactivity, and user flow of the design, including animations, transitions, and interactions.
- **Fidelity:** Can range from mid to high-fidelity, often looking and feeling like the final product.
- **Interactivity:** High. Prototypes often include full interactivity, allowing users to navigate the site and interact with elements as they would on the live site.
- **When to Use:** Later in the design process, once the basic structure and functionalities have been defined, and you want to test how the final product will function with actual users.

**Summary**

- **Sketching:** Quick, rough, and used for brainstorming early in the process.

- **Wireframing:** More structured, outlines layout and basic functionality without visual design details.

- **Prototyping:** Detailed and interactive, simulating the final product to test usability and functionality.

These three stages allow designers to incrementally build on ideas, refine designs, and test functionalities, leading to a more thoughtful and user-centered final product.
