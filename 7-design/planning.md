**Step 1 - Define the Project**

- Define: WHO the website is for? The target audience. WHAT the website is for? Business and User Goals. To provide information? To sell some product? To entertain the user?

**Step 2 - Plan the Project**

- Gather content: text, images, videos, etc.
- Plan the sitemap: what pages the site needs and how they are related to one another (content hierarchy).
- Based on the content you have, plan what sections each page needs in order to convey the content's message, and in which order. The content should guide the project and the design of the website.
- Based on everything you already know about the project, define the website personality.

**Step 3 - Sketch the Layout and Component Ideas**

- Think about what **components** you need, and how you can use them in **layout patterns**.
- **Sketch** / experiment with different components and layouts (with pen and paper)
- Wireframing / Prototyping

**Step 4 - Design**

- Design the Application in a design tool
- Consider: Website personality / design guidelines / inspiration / project's branding

**Step 5 - Build**

- Develop the Application

**Step 6 - Test and Optimize**

_...before lunching the project to the web_

- Test the app in all major browsers, on different devices.
- Optimize all images, test accessibility, run lighthouse, improve SEO.

**Step 7 - Launch the Project**

- Deploy the Application on the internet.
- Buy a domain name (representative, memorable, easy to write).

**Step 8 - Maintain and Keep Updating the Application**

- Install analytic software (Google Analytics or Fathom) to get statistics about website users. This may inform future changes to adapt the site structure and content.
